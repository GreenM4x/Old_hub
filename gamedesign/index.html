              In video games, storytelling helps the players feel involved in
              the game and encourages them to understand what to do next. The player is a part of the story and
              experiences it firsthand Storytelling in video games can be done through videos
              or animations and is accompanied by player actions and dialogue.

          <div class="storytxt txtorder hidden_left">
            <p>
              In role-playing video games, the story is central, and players
              must progress as the story continues. An example of a
              role-playing game is The Legend of Zelda or Fallout. In
              adventure games, the player can explore more and create their
              “own stories” while trying to complete missions to progress.
              Games in which storytelling is not so obvious are platform
              games. There is a general story and a task to accomplish, but
              the accent is on the player's skills to pass as many levels as
              possible. An example of a platform game is Super Mario Bros or
              Mario 64.

            Game art is an essential aspect of game design and refers to the
            visual elements of a video game, including characters,
            environments, and items. The goal of game art is to create an
            immersive and believable world for players to interact with. Game
            artists use a variety of software and techniques, such as 3D
            modeling and animation, to create the assets that make up a game's
            world. They also collaborate with game designers and programmers
            to ensure that the art fits the overall design and functionality
            of the game. Good game art should not only look good but also
            serve the gameplay and enhance the player's experience.
            Additionally, game art also includes the design of the user
            interface, which is the way players interact with the game,
            including menus, buttons, and on-screen prompts. In short, Game
            art is a vital part of game design that creates the visual and
            interactive elements of a game that players interact with.

            Level design is an important aspect of game design that involves
            creating the environments and layouts in which the game takes
            place. This includes creating the geometry of the level, placing
            objects and assets, and scripting events and gameplay mechanics.
            The goal of level design is to create an engaging and immersive
            experience for the player, while also challenging them with
            obstacles and enemies. Good level design takes into consideration
            the game's mechanics and objectives, as well as the overall
            aesthetic and theme of the game. Ultimately, level design helps to
            define the player's journey through the game, and can greatly
            impact the player's enjoyment and engagement with the game.

              Hello, I'm Maximilian Keller and in my free time, I enjoy
              playing and coding video games. I don't have professional
              experience in it, but I learned a lot over the last couple of
              years by learning by trial and error.
